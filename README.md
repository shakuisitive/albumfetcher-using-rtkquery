Album Manager using RTK Query

Just got done creating this app that that allows users to create and delete users, albums and pictures using RTK Query which helps eliminate the need for manual reducers and thunks for API calls and makes the entire process more straightforward.

While the app may seem simple, the purpose was solely to learn Redux Toolkit Query in isolation to make sure I master this tool rather than getting sidetracked by adding and working on features that have no relevance to RTK Query. Only used a bit of Tailwind CSS to create a simple UI but that‚Äôs about it.

Narrowing down my focus allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of this tool including:

- Creating APIs

- Caching

- Tag-based revalidation

- Data synchronization

- Middlewares and more!
- 
Check it out!
